# Boolets

# [Use it now](https://whurleywhurley.github.io/boolets)

## Why?
Because writing bullets sucks, our system for bullets suck, and we are forced to make homemade tools to fix their shortcomings.

## No really, why?
Because I wanted/dreamt of having a tool like this, and after some practice time with Javascript/HTML/CSS I got a bit cocky.

## How is this any different from [other tool]?
Most other tools aren't working for the new format that is in myEval. And, to be honest, none of the functionality is brand new. There are other tools out there that have different/better functionality, ease of access, and look a lot prettier. If I was any good at coding, I would have made changes to their product to enhance it. Instead, I made this. If you've got the skills to take this code and integrate it elsewhere, please do! And let me know that you've done it.
