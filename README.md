## Demo

## How to use
Instructions are on the website. Type or paste in bullets, and it'll highlight sections for you.

Lines that are too long will highlight red, too short and they will be green.
You can customize the length you want as too long/short.

Acronyms are highlighted blue and output below the textbox for you.

Potentially resued action/impact/result verbs are highlighted in yellow.

There is an experimental abbreviations functionality, but it might be prone to errors. Use at your own risk, and be sure to follow the instructions!

## Why?
Because writing bullets sucks, our system for bullets suck, and we are forced to make homemade tools to fix their shortcomings.

## No really, why?
Because I wanted/dreamt of having a tool like this, and after some practice time with Javascript/HTML/CSS I got a bit cocky.

## How is this any different from [other tool]?
Most other tools aren't working for the new format that is in myEval. And, to be honest, none of the functionality is brand new. There are other tools out there that have different/better functionality, ease of access, and look a lot prettier. If I was any good at coding, I would have made changes to their product to enhance it. Instead, I made this. If you've got the skills to take this code and integrate it elsewhere, please do! And let me know that you've done it.
